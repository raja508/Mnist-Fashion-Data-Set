# Mnist-Fashion-Data-Set
Fashion MNIST is a dataset of grayscale images of clothing items, created by Zalando Research. It consists of 70,000 images of size 28Ã—28 pixels, divided into 60,000 training and 10,000 test samples. Each image represents a fashion product from one of 10 categories, such as T-shirt/top, trouser, dress, and sneaker. The dataset is designed as a more challenging and realistic alternative to the original MNIST digit dataset and is widely used for benchmarking machine learning models in image classification tasks
